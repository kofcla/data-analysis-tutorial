# Data analysis tutorial for Python

This directory contains recources to help you get started with Python plotting and data analyis for lab courses or similar tasks. This only gives examples of how things can be done, this does not necessarily have to be the best or only way. 

## Contents

### article.pdf
Here you find an article originally written for the student newspaper \emph{Distribution} by the Faculty of Physics of the University of Vienna. 
This gives context as well as instructions for getting a python environment and virtual environment set up. 

### article folder
The folder containing the raw LaTex files for the article.

### data-analysis-tutorial.ipynb
A jupyter notebook to give you a quickstart for simple data plotting and analysis. The packages numpy, scipy, matplotlib and tabulate are needed.
Feel free to play around with the code.

### image-analyis-tutorial.ipynb
Here we focus on plotting and analyzing images in Python. This notebook was developed for a science communication project by the physics of nanostructured materials group of the University of Vienna in the department of Physics. It therefore focuses on thresholding of scanning transmission electron microscopy images. 

### more-detail-dataIO-plotting.ipynb
A bit more detail on different plotting options in matplotlib and a look at data IO with python read/write.
